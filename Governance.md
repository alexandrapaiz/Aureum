# 🛡️ Aureum Governance & Maintainer Charter

**Aureum is a nonprofit protocol. It is not a company, product, or tokenized startup. It is a public trust infrastructure designed to enforce monetary discipline, transparency, and resilience.**

## 🧭 Guiding Principles
- **Integrity over growth**: We prioritize correctness and security above adoption speed.
- **No monetary discretion**: No entity may create AUR without corresponding verified gold deposits.
- **Transparency by default**: All protocol rules, oracle logic, audits, and supply dynamics must be fully public.
- **Open participation, protected identity**: Anyone may review or contribute code; the Aureum brand and standard are safeguarded against misrepresentation.

## 🧑‍🔧 Maintainer Model
- The protocol is maintained by a group of core contributors under the Aureum Foundation.
- All smart contract changes must be:
  - Proposed via pull request
  - Audited independently
  - Reviewed by at least two maintainers
  - Publicly discussed in GitHub issues
- Emergency fixes may be approved by a multi-sig of three core maintainers, subject to post-review.

## 📜 Governance Scope
- **Immutable logic**: The following protocol rules are immutable unless a critical security flaw is found:
  - Minting must be collateralized 1:1 with gold
  - Only registered vaults with valid oracles may affect supply
  - No tokens may be pre-minted, inflated, or arbitrarily burned
- **Upgradable components**:
  - Vault registry (to support more providers)
  - Oracle integration logic (as new standards emerge)
  - Frontend dashboard (UX, language, APIs)

## 🤝 Contributor Expectations
- All contributors must follow best practices for security, code quality, and documentation.
- Suggestions for improvement should be submitted as GitHub issues or PRs.
- Contributors are invited to join governance discussions, but no tokens or monetary rights are distributed.

## 🔒 Ethical Commitment
> *“We believe monetary systems should serve the people—not those who issue the money.”*

Aureum commits to never profiting from issuance, custody, or spread. The protocol exists to enable a verifiable, voluntary, and incorruptible gold standard for the digital age.
